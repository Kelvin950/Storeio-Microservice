## üìô About this Project

This is my first project on microservices. I followed[Stephen Griders course on Microservices](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/).
However I am yet to add more functionalities of my own to it and I cannot wait to create more microservices projects.
