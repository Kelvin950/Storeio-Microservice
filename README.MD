## üìô About this Project

Continuing on my journey to expand my expertise in microservices architecture, I've successfully developed and orchestrated four distinct services, each addressing specific functionalities. This implementation has underscored my commitment to embracing the polyglot persistence approach, which led me to connect these services with two diverse NoSQL databases, MongoDB and Cassandra. By adopting this approach, I've ensured that each service is paired with the database technology that optimally complements its requirements.

My pursuit of knowledge in microservices also extends to Infrastructure. Employing Terraform, I skillfully orchestrated the creation of a Kubernetes cluster within the Azure cloud environment. This endeavor showcased my proficiency in infrastructure as code and validated my ability to seamlessly bridge the gap between development and operations. This accomplishment also exemplifies my readiness to harness the power of cloud computing and modern deployment practices to bolster the scalability and reliability of my microservices architecture.
